# Audit Lifecycle Management Platform

## Overview

This is a comprehensive web-based audit and lead management platform designed for enterprise auditors and channel partners. The system supports planning, executing, and reporting audits across industries (Pharma, Chemical, etc.) while managing the complete lead lifecycle from generation to conversion. The platform features a modern, data-focused enterprise UI with real-time dashboards, configurable workflows, and master data management capabilities.
