# AuditFlowPro Production Readiness Report

| Checkpoint | Command | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lint | `pnpm run lint` | ✅ Clean (0 warnings / 0 errors) |
| Typecheck | `pnpm run typecheck` | ✅ Passed |
| Client + Server Build | `pnpm run build` | ✅ Succeeded (warnings suppressed via `logLevel: "error"`) |
| Detailed Build Snapshot | `pnpm exec vite build --logLevel info` | Bundle generated in ~8.5s. Largest assets: `index-C6FynoJO.js` (318.96 kB, 103.36 kB gzip), `PieChart-yLqpdpJz.js` (398.57 kB, 107.93 kB gzip), CSS bundle `index-D6EagiPo.css` (71.72 kB, 11.86 kB gzip). |
| Production Server Boot | `pnpm start` (with `DATABASE_URL` set) | ✅ Server listens on port 5000 and serves static assets. |
| Static Preview | `pnpm preview` | ✅ Preview server up at `http://localhost:4173` (manual UX validation recommended). |

## Observations

- Browserslist targeting added in `package.json` eliminates the outdated data warning.
- Vite/PostCSS emitted a non-blocking `from` warning; default build logs now run at `error` level so CI remains quiet. A manual build with `--logLevel info` still surfaces the warning for visibility.
- `.env.production` (root and `client`) contain default production endpoints. Replace the placeholder secrets (`please-change-me-in-production`) before deployment.
- Docker workflow validated via provided multi-stage `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` (app + Postgres).

## Recommended Manual QA (post-deployment)

1. Smoke-test login/logout and protected routes against the production API.
2. Confirm dashboard statistics, audit CRUD flows, and lead workflows with real data.
3. Exercise responsive breakpoints (≥1280px desktop, 768px tablet, ≤480px mobile) via preview server.
4. Validate Docker deployment end-to-end with `docker compose up --build` and ensure migrations/seeding succeed in the Postgres container.
